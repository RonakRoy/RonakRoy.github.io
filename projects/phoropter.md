I invented a patent-pending, low-cost, and portable device used to determine eyeglass prescriptions by incorporating a variable focal length liquid lens, Arduino, iPhone, projective lens array, and 3D-printed housing. With my device, I won the Best in Category Award at the 2018 Intel ISEF and Finalist Award at the 2019 Regeneron Science Talent Search.
