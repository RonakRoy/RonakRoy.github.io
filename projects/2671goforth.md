title: 2.671 Go Forth and Measure Project

In 2.671: Measurement and Instrumentation, the Junior-level laboratory course in MIT Mechanical Engineering, students conduct a term-long project known as the Go Forth and Measure Project, in which we use the measurement and analysis techniques learned in the class to investigate a question of our choosing. I looked into how changing pH and water concentration used to water lucky bamboo plants affects their growth and strength; to do this, I had to construct an experimental setup that constantly monitors soil moisture level and pumps water to maintain it.
