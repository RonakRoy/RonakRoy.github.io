Every year, each student of 2.007: Design and Manufacturing I designs and fabricates a robot to compete in the class competition. This is my robot for the 2021 competition, Home Alone Together. In Spring 2021, due to the coronavirus, the class was taught remotely. As such, we had to design and fabricate our entire robot using only hand tools that were shipped to us.

The 30-second autnomous run is initiated by detecting the flashlight being shone at a photoelectric sensor. After the first 30 seconds, the mode switches into a 90-second driver controlled period.</div>
