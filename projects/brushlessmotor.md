title: Brushless DC Motor

For my freshman year advising seminar, I designed and fabricated a fully packaged, Teensy-controlled, four-phase brushless DC motor. I fabricated it using 3D printing and laser cutting. The motor consisted of four components:
* **Rotor:** Contains 12 press-fit permanent magnets, mounted on a D-shaft
* **Stator:** Contains 8 drill-wound coils and two hall effect sensors for phase sensing
* **Electronics Panel:** Contains the Teensy, micro-USB breakout board, and two dual H-drives to control each electromagnet pair
* **Base Case:** The structural component that aligns the electronics panel and stator and stabilizes the rotor’s D-shaft
