title: 2.007 Competition Robot
description: Feb 2021 â€” May 2021

Every year, each student of 2.007: Design and Manufacturing I designs and fabricates a robot to compete in the class competition. My robot for the 2021 competition: \"Home Alone Together\" was able to extend to twice its height to lift 8kg, push game elements, and both cut and ride down a zipline. The competition has two-parts: the 30-second autnomous operation period, which is initiated by detecting the flashlight being shone at a photoelectric sensor, and the 90-second driver controlled period that follows.
