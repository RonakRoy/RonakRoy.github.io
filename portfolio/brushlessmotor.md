title: Brushless DC Motor

As a part of my freshman year advising seminar, 6.A01, I designed and fabricated fully-functional brushless DC motor from scratch. It featured wire-wound electromagnetic coils, an outrunner-style rotor with embedded permanent magnets, and a custom electronics panel that enabled four-phase control.

My motor design consisted of four components:
* **Rotor:** Contains 12 press-fit permanent magnets, mounted on a D-shaft
* **Stator:** Contains 8 drill-wound coils and two hall effect sensors for phase sensing
* **Electronics Panel:** Contains the Teensy, micro-USB breakout board, and two dual H-drives to control each electromagnet pair
* **Base Case:** The structural component that aligns the electronics panel and stator and stabilizes the rotor’s D-shaft
