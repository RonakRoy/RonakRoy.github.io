I invented a patent-pending, low-cost, and portable device used to determine eyeglass prescriptions by incorporating a variable focal length liquid lens, Arduino, iPhone, projective lens array, and 3D-printed housing. With my device, I won the Best in Category Award at the 2018 Intel ISEF and Finalist Award at the 2019 Regeneron Science Talent Search.

##### Project Details
I submitted a Nonprovisional Utility Patent application in the United States, and my invention is currently under review by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Unfortunately, for the sake of protecting my IP, I will only upload further details once my patent application has been granted. -->
