The term project in Intro to Robotics was to modify a mobile robot to scoop and deposit "lunar regolith." We developed a 3-DOF robot scoop mechanism with steppers and DC motors, and I wrote the backing suite of ROS nodes for low level feedback control, computer vision-based localization and detection, and trajectory planning and execution.
