Over IAP 2022, I tackled a small personal project to connect the lights and door in my room with the rest of my smart-home setup. I designed a system that was able to detect light switch state state and physically interact with the switch and door handle without interfering with manual operation. In September 2022, I made some minor improvements the design.
