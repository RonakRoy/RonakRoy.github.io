title: "Cast Iron Camelback Straightedge"
description: "Feb 2023 â€” Now"
---

As a Senior Pappalardo Apprentice, I designed a camelback straightedge that I am fabricating out of cast iron. I designed the pattern to be machined out of foam and packed a two-part flask with green sand onto the pattern halves. Mike Tarkanian of the MIT Foundry and Forge poured the cast iron into the flask, after which I broke it out and post machined the flat surfaces. The final steps are the surface grind and then hand-scrape the flat, both of which I will be doing over the coming weeks.
