title: Gemini Front Suspension Geometric Analysis
description: Jan 2022 â€” Mar 2022

For Gemini, MIT SEVT's upcoming multi-occupant solar car, I was one of the leads on the suspension and steering system. In determining the dimensions of the front double-A arm suspension, I developed a number of analytical tools to quantify the compatibility with the car's aeroshell and dynamic response to bump and droop.
