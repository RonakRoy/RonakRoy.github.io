For my Master's research, I developed a high-bandwidth, high-precision dynamometer for motor characterization. Its key feature is a easy-to-use alignment mechanism that can achieve excellent shaft-to-shaft alignment with sub-5 micron precision. I developed this system with the guidance of/as the term project for 2.77, taught by Prof. Alex Slocum.
