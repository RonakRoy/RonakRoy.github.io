    image_path="/assets/images/portfolio/212robot.png"
    subheader="Feb 2022 — May 2022"
    description="The term project in Intro to Robotics was to modify a mobile robot to scoop and deposit \"lunar regolith.\" I designed and fabricated parts of our 3-DOF robot scoop mechanism with steppers and DC motors, and I wrote the backing suite of ROS nodes for low level feedback control, computer vision-based localization and detection, and trajectory planning and execution."

    subheader="Jan 2022"
    description="Over IAP 2022, I tackled a mini-personal project to connect the lights and door in my room with the rest of my smart-home setup. I designed a system that was able to detect light switch state state and physically interact with the switch and door handle without interfering with manual operation."

    subheader="Sep 2021 — Dec 2021"
    description="For Gemini, MIT SEVT's upcoming multi-occupant solar car, I was a lead on the suspension and steering system. In determining the dimensions of the front double-A arm suspension, I developed a number of analytical tools to quantify the compatibility with the car's aeroshell and dynamic response to bump and droop."
