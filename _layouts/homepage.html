                My name's Ronak. I'm an undergraduate student at MIT studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Now that you're
                around, why don't you check out some of the things I've made, teams I've been a part of, or research I've done? You can also
                scroll down to learn a little bit more about who I am and what I do.
