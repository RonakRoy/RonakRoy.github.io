{% include card.html image_side="left" title="Education" page_url="/coursework/" image_path="/assets/images/mit.jpeg" description="A theoretical knowledge is the foundation of my skillset as an engineer, and I've sought to grow that foundation from inside the classroom. As a student at MIT, I've had the privilege to take fascinating classes not only in my field, but in HASS (humanities, arts, and social sciences) and other engineering subjects!" %}

{% include card.html image_side="right" title="Research" page_url="/research/" image_path="/assets/images/research.jpeg" description="I've been able to apply my knowledge of computer science, electronics, and mechanical engineering in research. I've done research with labs from UC San Diego and MIT. I also developed a portable device that gives eyeglass prescriptions, a project that I competed with at international science and engineering fairs." %}

{% include card.html image_side="left" title="Engineering Teams" page_url="/teams/" image_path="/assets/images/teams.jpeg" description="My FRC and ASC teams have given me hands-on engineering learning opportunities. Through these programs, I've learned about controls systems, mechanical design, and manufacturing, but most importantly, I've made amazing, passionate friends who've enabled me to grow as an engineer, as a leader, and as a person." %}

{% include card.html image_side="right" title="Projects" page_url="/projects/" image_path="/assets/images/projects.png" description="Last, but certainly not least, I've employed the design, build, test, scrap, and repeat cycle on personal projects as well as projects for classes and my engineering teams. Forging ahead using all the resources at my disposal have allowed me to learn a lot (and fail a lot), while making some cool things along the way." %}
