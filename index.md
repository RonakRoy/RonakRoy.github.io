    description="A theoretical knowledge is the foundation of my skillset as an engineer, and I've sought to grow that foundation from inside the classroom. As a student at MIT, I've had the privilege to take fascinating classes not only in my field, but in HASS (humanities, arts, and social sciences) and other engineering subjects." %}

    description="Last, but certainly not least, I've employed the engineering process of design, build, test, repeat on personal projects as well as projects for classes and my engineering teams. Forging ahead using all the resources at my disposal have allowed me to learn (and fail) a lot, while making some cool things along the way." %}
