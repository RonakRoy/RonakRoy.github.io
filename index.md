title: Hello!
description: I'm Ronak, and I'll be starting my Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at MIT in Prof. Sangbae Kim's Biomimetic Robotics Lab. I graduated from MIT with a Bachelor of Science, double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering. Here, you can check out what classes I've taken, internships I've completed, research I've contributed to, projects I've made, and teams I've been a part of.
