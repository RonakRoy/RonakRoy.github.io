Designed, simulated, and tested custom electromagnetic components, high-voltage connectors, and thermal management hardware for next-generation high voltage power conversion systems used in residential energy storage applications.  
• Modeled components (injection molded, sheet metal stamped, CNC machined) and assemblies (adhesive-bonded, laser welded, ultrasonically welded, CNC machined) using 3DX CATIA and ENOVIA  
• Managed DFM of custom electromagnetic component with novel design, communicating drawings (performed GD&T) and design revisions with multiple foreign suppliers  
• Built static structural study in ANSYS Mechanical to evaluate my redesigns of an out-of-spec component and calibrated/validated model by conducting hardware tests  
• Developed and helped manage hardware integration pipeline of sample units for delivery to reliability and EE teams  
• Constructed electromechanical test setups
