I was a member of Dr. Andreas Goetz’ research lab at UC San Diego, which primarily develops software that simulates molecular interactions by using machine learning to develop functions that accurately approximate the complex, compute-intensive quantum mechanical methods.
* Developed Python workflow tools as part of lab's machine learning framework  
* Tested lab software on specific molecules  
* Administered a compute cluster of nodes formerly used in a supercomputer  
* Conducted benchmark calculations of quantum mechanical methods
