* Helped develop the MIXER algorithm, a principled method for fusing associations across multiple modalities of sensing/perceptions
* Developed a demonstration of MIXER in ROS that detects and tracks cars in a parking lot by fusing YOLO object detections with odometry, LiDAR reconstructions, color data, and SIFT feature descriptors
  * Applied demo on a dataset collected using a Clearpath Jackal with a Intel RealSense camera and Velodyne LiDAR sensor to develop a MIXER demonstration
