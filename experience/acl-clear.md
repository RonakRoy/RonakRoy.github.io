I worked on implementing and integrating the CLEAR algorithm in a photorealistic simulator to enable a fleet of robots to collaboratively map an environment.
* Developed a platform-agnostic ROS node (with custom-defined messages) that runs the pairwise and multi-way matching algorithm; the node is designed to be deployed on any hardware or simulation stack.
* Laid out framework for developing and integrating other ROS algorithm nodes.
* Developed an adapter node that connects the Army Research Lab's Unity-based simulator.
